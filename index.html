  I'm a Dublin-born, Pittsburgh-based Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> at CMU advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/">Jeff Schneider</a>. I work primarily on <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> and <strong>Design of Experiments</strong>, although I am broadly interested in <strong>Uncertainty in Machine Learning</strong>. Before coming to CMU as a graduate student I enjoyed working with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sfs/">Stephen Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/isaac-isukapati/">Isaac Isukapati</a> in the <a href="http://www.ozone.ri.cmu.edu/">ICL Lab</a> through the <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/">RISS</a> program where I worked on <strong>Probabilistic Modelling</strong> of transportation systems. I studied Electronic Engineering in UCD as an undergraduate, and spent some time at UCLA as an exchange student.

  I co-host a show on <a href="http://www.wrct.org/">WRCT</a> showcasing my favourite Pittsburgh and Irish tech-house producers. In a parallel universe, I'm a <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/20519336">short-filmmaker</a>, and I'm hoping the universe is ergodic <em>enough</em> to let me pick that back up someday.
