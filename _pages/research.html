<p>I work primarily on <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> and <strong>Design of Experiments</strong>, although I am broadly interested in <strong>Uncertainty in Machine Learning</strong>. Before graduate school I did some work on <strong>Probabilistic Modelling</strong> for transportation systems. See my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dknW9_sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar</a> for the most up to date list of academic publications.</p>

          <p>We study the canonical multi-armed bandit problem under delayed feedback. Recently proposed algorithms have desirable regret bounds in the delayed-feedback setting but require strict prior knowledge of expected delays. In this work, we study the regret of such delay-resilient algorithms under milder assumptions on delay distributions. We experimentally investigate known theoretical performance bounds and attempt to improve on a recently proposed algorithm by making looser assumptions on prior delay knowledge. Further, we investigate the relationship between delay assumptions and marking an arm as suboptimal.</p>
